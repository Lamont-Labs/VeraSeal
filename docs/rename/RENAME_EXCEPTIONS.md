# Rename Exceptions

## Allowed Remaining Matches

The following files contain references to the old product names. These are explicitly allowed because they are historical documentation of the rename process itself.

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| docs/rename/NAME_DISCOVERY_REPORT.md | Documents original names found before rename |
| docs/rename/RENAME_CHANGELOG.md | Documents before/after snippets |

## No Other Exceptions

All other occurrences of "Veritas", "Sentinel Core", "Sentinel", "VeraGate", and "Decision Proof System" have been replaced with "VeraSeal".
